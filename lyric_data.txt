Ey, this is special what's happenin' to all my
All my all my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here,
What you need to do is be thankful
For the life you got, you know what I'm sayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
And start being thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life

Hey, never mind what haters say
Ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazin' they ungrateful
After all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way
For you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away
Now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege
Homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious
They violate in a major way
I never been a hater
Still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay'
You know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white
It has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway
Even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way
Not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood
And all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience
But they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray
Now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life
Can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life

I'm the opposite of moderate
Immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler
And the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit
Impartial to the politics
Articulate
But still'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems
With their record sales just holler TIP
If that don't work and all else fails
Then turn around and follow TIP
I got love for the game
But ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame
And rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin'
Back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know
What you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account
And you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches
'Cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh)

Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' away
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (Shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you sometime
And I wanna spend some time with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

We look for love, no time for tears
Wasted water's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not for those who wait too late
We gotta go for all we know

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building them castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

I hear the crystal raindrops fall
On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
And darling when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I wanna be the one with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us, just
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building big castles way up high
Just the two of us
You and I

(Just the two of us)
(We can make it, just the two of us)
(Just the two of us)

You are appreciated

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys, breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Hugging on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady
Don't you know we love ya? Sweet lady
Dear mama
Place no one above ya, sweet lady
You are appreciated
Don't ya know we love ya?

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hanging
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
Ya just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady
Don't you know we love ya? Sweet lady
And dear mama
Place no one above ya, sweet lady
You are appreciated
Don't ya know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady
Don't you know we love ya? Sweet lady
And dear mama
Place no one above ya, sweet lady
You are appreciated
Don't ya know we love ya?

Sweet lady
And dear mama

Dear mama
Lady, lady, lady
